NoTrac3 Internal Brief – RevGirl: Full Betrayal Summary (Updated & Final)
19 November 2025
NoTrac3 Intelligence Division

Subject
Discord UID: 1349516710566170754
Primary server: DecafJokers (owner)
Secondary affiliations: RageSec, Universal Union, Enclave/UETR, DPOS/UTTP remnants, Anti-Degen Legion backup network

Timeline

6 November 2025 – late afternoon
m77u1n terminated all contact with RevGirl and restricted any future interaction to business-only or none.

6 November 2025 – same evening (within 3–4 hours)
RevGirl compiled a complete personal information packet containing:
- full home address
- personal and family phone numbers
- recent face photographs
- old payment screenshots
- additional identifying details previously shared in confidence

She then personally delivered the identical packet to every major hostile entity:

1. DecafJokers – her own server (owner tag visible)
2. RageSec leadership channels – direct delivery to lilrage and core members
3. Universal Union main raid channel
4. Enclave / UETR – handed directly to Ethan
5. DPOS / UTTP remnant channels – Emperor T, rxmwmcrx limited, General Sanguinius, etc.
6. Anti-Degen Legion backup servers

RevGirl functioned as the sole courier that reconnected and synchronized all previously fragmented threat actors into one unified, real-time campaign.

Post-leak activity (6–18 November 2025)
- Remained continuously active inside the hostile channels
- Issued timing instructions for swatting calls, wellness checks, and spam waves
- Supplied additional targeting notes and follow-up details
- Relayed messages between group leaders (lilrage ↔ Ethan ↔ Emperor T ↔ Delta ↔ marshsl)
- Encouraged escalation after each wave
- Directly praised leaders for successful actions

Unintended consequence
Her distribution and coordination created the first fully documented, real-time proof that these groups operate as a single coordinated network rather than independent actors. Every cross-group message, shared packet, and relayed order is now permanently archived.

Current status – 19 November 2025
- Permanently blacklisted across all NoTrac3 and allied infrastructure
- UID 1349516710566170754 locked in ACC bot (auto-ban on sight, effective Sunday deployment)
- Designated primary instigator and central coordinating node of the entire November 2025 assault
- All distribution logs, timestamps, message chains, and cross-group coordination screenshots preserved in CyberCrimeDB and ThreatDB under dedicated RevGirl folder set

Conclusion
The entire November 2025 coordinated assault – from the initial dox wave to the sustained harassment campaign – originated from the packet RevGirl personally compiled and distributed on the evening of 6 November 2025. She then spent the following two weeks actively directing and synchronizing the actions of multiple hostile networks.

Her actions did not achieve the intended result.
They produced the clearest evidence map NoTrac3 has ever obtained of how these groups function as one criminal structure.

End of brief.
