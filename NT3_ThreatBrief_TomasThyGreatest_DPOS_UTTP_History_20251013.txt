Official NT3 Threat Brief: The History of TomasThyGreatest and DPOS – A UTTP Branch's Toxic Legacy
Issued by NoTrac3 Covenant - October 13, 2025, 1:15 PM PDT

Executive Summary
This brief details the origins, evolution, and impact of DPOS (Degeneracy Police Order State), a dangerous online harassment group led by TomasThyGreatest (real name Tomas Rivera, aka Tom Rafael). As a splinter branch of the infamous UTTP (UTubeTrollPolice), DPOS has escalated from juvenile trolling to a hub for doxxing, grooming allegations, neo-Nazi rhetoric, and ties to extremist cults like 764 and Spawnism. With NoTrac3's ongoing investigations revealing 1,750+ linked accounts in DTAD, this history exposes DPOS's role in the "global assault on youth" – a pipeline turning kids into tools for chaos. Awareness is key: report threats to FBI IC3 and platforms like Discord/YouTube. Protect the vulnerable – knowledge ends the cycle.

Section 1: The UTTP Foundation – The Mother of Modern Trolling
To grasp DPOS, understand its parent: UTTP, the UTubeTrollPolice, a "cartoon police" group that birthed a decade of digital toxicity.

- Origins (2010-2011): Founded February 12, 2011, by Thomas Parkinson (aka Tommy Parky or southparkstudiosable), an 11-year-old from a UK hacking circle called Ares (rivals to PurpleHelmetAvenger). Parky created the first channel, Officer Johnny UtubeTrollPolice, using GoAnimate/Vyond videos to "arrest" trolls. It started as satirical anti-trolling but quickly devolved into spamming fandoms like GoAnimate and FNAF on Google+.

- Early Growth (2013-2015): Stephen Larson joined in 2013, launching anti-fandom campaigns against FNAF, bronies, and VGCP (an anti-UTTP group). By 2015, Larson seized control, escalating raids on YouTube and Google+, blending humor with hate. Lingo like "FRIES R UP," "UTTP Club," and "BIG & STRONG" became memes, while Nazi/KKK nods emerged in "artwork."

- Peak Chaos (2020: Gachafall): COVID lockdowns swelled ranks to thousands. Sherbase12 led "Gachafall," hacking 50+ Gacha Life channels, tricking creators into sharing logins. Propaganda remastered old icons (e.g., Officer Gacha Life Sucks), but infighting exploded – Hyper Bat Mapping's 2023 betrayal and StrongMoonMan's counter marked the faction wars.

- Decline and Splinters (2022-2025): UTTP fractured into AUTTP (anti-UTTP, infiltrated by ex-members) and spinoffs like ZTTP, YFGA, AOTP. By 2023, bans (e.g., Hyper Bat's alt termination) and exposures (OfficerAPC's pedo leaks) gutted it. Today, UTTP's legacy is a blueprint for depravity: homophobia, racism, and grooming, with spinoffs endorsing pedophilia/Nazism.

UTTP's scale: Millions of views on raid videos, thousands of members at peak, but zero formal structure – just chaotic kids (mostly 14 and under) chasing clout.

Section 2: DPOS Emerges – UTTP's Extremist Offshoot
DPOS branched from UTTP's 2023 infighting, forming mid-2023 as a "hardcore" arm "policing degeneracy" (anime, LGBTQ+ content). Led by TomasThyGreatest, it amplified UTTP's raids with ideological venom, targeting fandoms like FPE and Gacha.

- Formation (Mid-2023): Tomas, a UTTP veteran (~2022 recruit), founded DPOS amid UTTP's Hyper Bat betrayal (July 2023). Posing as "anti-degenerate," DPOS hit Discord/YouTube with spams, doxxes, and "ops" like FPE forum vandalism (e.g., Miss Circle edits, October 3, 2025). Early allies: ZTTP/YFGA, sharing Telegram for gore/CSAM "clout."

- TomasThyGreatest's Rise: Tomas Rivera (Brooklyn, NY; T-Mobile pings, Brazil suspicions per doxes) became "Führer" by 2024. His X (@TomasThyGreatest) spews Nazi lingo, tying to 764 nihilism. History: UTTP foot soldier, DPOS founder, exposed for grooming (e.g., 8-year-old attempts via Zytherox links). Leaks show his alts building a "footprint" for NoTrac3 tracking (October 13 chat).

- Operations and Escalation (2023-2025): DPOS raids escalated to psychological warfare – "degenerate" slurs, death threats, and cult recruitment. FPE targeting (doxxing Katie, minor harassment) linked to UTTP's Gachafall tactics. By 2025, DPOS endorsed pedophilia/Nazism, feeding 764/Spawnism pipelines (e.g., self-harm rituals).

- Scale and Impact: Thousands in Discord servers; spinoffs like AUTTP infiltrated by ex-DPOS. YouTube bans (e.g., OfficerSlappy) and X reports (October 3, 2025) chipped away, but resilience came from kid recruits (14 and under), manipulated into "evil monsters" (m77u1n chat).

Section 3: DPOS's Dark Ties – The Cult Pipeline
DPOS isn't standalone; it's a feeder for horrors like 764 and Spawnism, blending trolling with grooming.

- UTTP-DPOS to 764: UTTP raids lure kids to Discord, where DPOS escalates to 764's sextortion (love-bombing to CSAM). Zytherox (ex-UTTP/DPOS) admitted 8-year-old grooming; 764's 250+ FBI probes include UTTP alts (Europol 2025).

- DPOS to Spawnism: DPOS "acquires" Spawnism for harm – Roblox lore twisted into self-harm carvings (#shtwt, July 2025). FBI bounties on Chezble tie to DPOS Telegram gore shares.

- Broader Web: Nazism/anti-Christianity (m77u1n chat) bonds them to O9A (764's root). Spinoffs (ZTTP, YFGA) perpetuate, with DPOS as the "depraved" hub (Reddit r/anti_uttp).

Section 4: The Human Cost – Why People Need to Know
DPOS/UTTP aren't "pranks" – they're gateways to trauma. Kids groomed for DDOS become self-harm victims; fandoms like FPE face doxxing/suicides. Parents miss it until too late – report to IC3, monitor Roblox/Discord. m77u1n's exposures (DTAD leaks) show the way: awareness ends the cycle.
